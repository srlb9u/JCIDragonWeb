	The organization's objectives are carried out through the FOUR AREAS OF OPPORTUNITIES, namely individual; community; international and business.
	 
	###Individual 

	Through various leadership training programs, members develop valuable skills such as goal setting, time-management, public speaking, parliamentary procedures, protocol, etc., thereby equipping them with necessary techniques to become future leaders of the community.

	###Community

	Through various community development programs such as Youth Business Hong Kong (YBHK) campaign, members identify social needs and issues, and develop projects to improve the well-being of the community based on their own expertise in business knowledge and entrepreneurial skills.  Awareness and sensitivity on community problems are thus enhanced.

	###Business
