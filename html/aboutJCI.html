<p>2014 JCI President Shine Bhaskaran extends JCI members his sincere gratitude for their dedication to active citizenship through JCI and looks forward to an exciting year of creating sustainable impact worldwide. By 2014 JCI President Shine Bhaskaran 
Dear JCI members,
I would first like to wish you all a happy new year and hope that your holidays were filled with joy. I have the exciting responsibility this year not only as a member of this organization, but also as a leader to unite young active citizens around the world as we focus on impact. Starting my JCI career in 1999 serving in multiple leadership roles and moving on to serve JCI at the international level in 2011, I am honored and excited to take on this new, dynamic role. 2014 is a very important year for our organization. JCI will embark on an ambitious journey taking action to create sustainable impact locally and globally. Our rich history allows us to fondly remember the past and look forward to a bright future filled with an even greater capacity to change the world. 2014 marks the beginning of a shift of focus where traditional solutions are no longer sufficient. We recognize that the challenges of today require young people to engage in their communities for the greater good. To achieve this goal of creating a better world and start on a strong path to be the organization that unites all sectors of society to create sustainable impact, there are five key strategies I encourage each JCI Local and National Organization to focus on in the upcoming year. </p>
<h3 id="impact">IMPACT</h3>
<p>Creating sustainable impact in 2014 is important because it leads to a world where human security is a reality for all global citizens. Human security is the protection of an individual&#39;s human rights while ensuring social, economic and environmental opportunity, development and well being for every individual and their communities. As active citizens, JCI Local and National Organization can align their actions to this strategy by running JCI Active Citizen Framework projects, under the community development stages of Health and Wellness, Education and Economic Empowerment and Sustainability and reporting these projects to JCI. Further, we can extend our support by participating in JCI Impact Months and also involving our efforts in campaigns like JCI Operation Hope and JCI Nothing But Nets. </p>
<h3 id="motivate">MOTIVATE</h3>
<p>Fostering motivation in 2014 is very significant because tackling the challenges of today requires empowered, passionate global citizens to take action. To motivate you must communicate, so share your story of impact with others. Exchanging best practices through skill development courses, at JCI Events or even through local tools and resources created in your own organizations are all great ways to align your actions as JCI members to this strategy. </p>
<h3 id="invest">INVEST</h3>
<p>Investment is essential in 2014 because active citizens are responsible for sustaining progress to advance our mutual goals. JCI Local and National Organizations can align their actions to this strategy by utilizing a financial expert when planning their budget. I also encourage fellow JCI members and Senators to support the JCI Foundation, sustaining the development projects and initiatives conducted with the help of these funds. </p>
<h3 id="collaborate">COLLABORATE</h3>
<p>Collaboration is crucial in 2014 because it unites like-minded active citizens to expand our ability to create sustainable solutions. Increase collaboration by finding a local partner with shared goals or posting your project in the JCI Project Gallery to share your story of impact with fellow members worldwide. I also encourage each member to collaborate with our new partner the UN Millennium Campaign to share their voice in the MYWorld global survey and increase our participation in the development of the post 2015 global agenda. Our commitment to the Millennium Development Goals remains extremely important and as we create change in our communities, we must think of how this change is sustainable for the future. Collaboration in 2014 should also be exercised through the gathering of historical information and planning for the 100-year anniversary celebration of the JCI movement in 2015. The celebration of this milestone for our organization allows us to showcase our rich history and exciting future to othrorganizations as we unite all sectors of society to expand our impact. </p>
<h3 id="connect">CONNECT</h3>
<p>Connection is important in 2014 because sharing ideas and actions will result in a global movement that creates positive change. Something that connects all JCI members, partners and friends is the JCI Active Citizen Framework. I will work to see that all National Organizations have the tools and resources necessary to conduct impactful projects using the Framework in their communities. Creating new communication tools and resources in 2014 at the local, national and international level will also help grow our global JCI movement. Idea and information sharing is crucial and I ask each and every one of you to think of ways to increase the connection internally and externally within your Local and National Organizations. </p>
<h3 id="unite-to-impact-in-2014">Unite to Impact in 2014</h3>
<p>JCI members remain united by their commitment to the JCI Mission, Vision and Values and their passion for positive change. With the long-term goal to be the organization that unites all sectors of society to create sustainable impact, our other main commitment that unites us is impact. Whether it is on a local, national or global level, sustainable impact is the result of shared ownership of challenges and solutions by all community members. By Uniting to Impact, working together and sharing best practices, we can amplify the sustainability and impact of our projects, increase the reach of our programs and raise the visibility of our organization, all while helping create a better world. I encourage all JCI members to attend National Conventions, 2014 JCI Area Conferences, the 2014 JCI Global Partnership Summit and the 2014 JCI World Congress in Leipzig, Germany to develop new relationships and build on existing friendships. These events also provide an important venue for members to showcase their activities and projects. These shared ideas and new collaborative partnerships inspire others to create similar solutions to common problems in their own communities. 
As 2014 begins, I ask you not only to focus on the year ahead but also to look at the bigger picture. 2014 marks a year of change, a year of impact and the first year of our five-year strategic plan. It is our responsibility to start with a positive attitude, a passion for change and a shift in our mindset from numbers to impact. Our goal to be the organization that unites all sectors of society to create sustainable impact cannot be accomplished in one year. However, I encourage you to align all of your actions to these five strategies to ensure that we are on a strong path to reach this long-term goal. 
As 2014 JCI President, I look forward to all the fun, excitement and hard work in the upcoming months. I extend my sincere gratitude to you and your commitment, service, leadership and passion for JCI.
Unite to Impact! 
Sincerely, 
Shine Bhaskaran
2014 JCI President </p>

<h3 id="approaching-the-100th-anniversary-of-jci-s-first-local-organization">Approaching the 100th Anniversary of JCI&#39;s First Local Organization</h3>
<p><img id="Henry" src="" ></p>
<p>In 2015, we’ll celebrate the 100th Anniversary of JCI&#39;s First Local Organization, originally established under the name of &quot;Young Men&#39;s Progressive Civic Association (YMPCA).&quot;</p>
<p>Almost a century ago, Henry &quot;Hy&quot; Giessenbier, Jr., and a group of young people decided to take responsibility for their personal and professional development as well as for the progress and welfare of their community by helping tackle difficult problems around them. Together with other 32 young men,  Giessenbier established the Young Men&#39;s Progressive Civic Association (YMPCA), JCI&#39;s First Local Organization, at the Mission Inn in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 13, 1915.</p>
<p>Since 1915, countless dedicated young leaders like Giessenbier have ensured the organization&#39;s progress while contributing to the development of JCI members and the advancement of their communities. Their efforts and achievements must not be forgotten.</p>
<p>The historic information presented here is an effort to honor those leaders. Thanks to contributions from former JCI officers, staff members, members in general and collaborators, we have gathered significant historic details. JCI publications have also been used as reference. We hope JCI&#39;s history will serve to inspire future generations of JCI members to emulate their predecessors and take the organization to higher and higher levels of accomplishment.</p>

    <div id="JCIHK"><h2 id="junior-chamber-international-hong-kong">Junior Chamber International Hong Kong</h2>
<p>Junior Chamber International Hong Kong (JCIHK) (formerly named as &quot;Hong Kong Junior Chamber&quot;), inaugurated in 1950, is affiliated with the worldwide leadership development organization – The Junior Chamber International (JCI). JCI has a worldwide membership of over 170,000 throughout 117 member nations.
In Hong Kong, we have about 1,500 members representing a network of highly motivated and forward looking young men and women who are mostly entrepreneurs or executives from a wide range of trades and businesses. The members are between the age of 18-40 who make full use of their leisure hours to work for the betterment of the community and themselves.
The purpose of Junior Chamber is to contribute to the advancement of the global community by providing the opportunity for the young people to develop their leadership skills, social responsibility, entrepreneurship, and fellowship necessary to create positive changes. It is attained through the following four areas of opportunity:</p>
<h3 id="individual">Individual</h3>
<p>Through various leadership training programs, members develop valuable skills such as goal setting, time-management, public speaking, parliamentary procedures, protocol, etc., thereby equipping them with necessary techniques to become future leaders of the community.</p>
<h3 id="community">Community</h3>
<p>Through various community development programs, members identify social needs and issues, and develop projects to improve the well-being of the community. Awareness and sensitivity on community problems are thus enhanced.</p>
<h3 id="international">International</h3>
<p>Through a network of 200,000 JCs in more than 100 countries around the world, members gain valuable international exposure, develop international friendship, and derive awareness on cross-border, cross-culture issues.</p>

    <div id="UNMDG"><h2 id="jci-and-the-un-millennium-development-goals-mdgs-">JCI and the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</h2>
<p>JCI has a Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1954</p>
<p>JCI Organizations use the UN MDGs, a set of time-bound and measurable goals and targets for combating poverty, as a framework for positive change in the community.</p>
<p>In 2009, JCI members will meet at the United Nations in Geneva for the JCI Leadership Summit on climate change.</p>
<p>In September 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit, world leaders agreed to a set of time-bound and measurable goals and targets for combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women. Placed at the heart of the global agenda, they are called the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and include eight main goals:</p>
<p>Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development</p>
<p>The eight goals provide a framework for governments, businesses, organizations and citizens to work coherently together towards a common end.</p>
<p>In this context, the world is making progress toward the MDGs, but it is uneven and too slow. A large majority of nations will reach the MDGs only if they get substantial support – advocacy, expertise and resources - from outside sources, such as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) like JCI.</p>
<p>Working in collaboration with the United Nations, JCI has held several Leadership Summits at the UN in New York. These Summits have helped JCI members learn about the UN and its projects, including those related with the MDGs.</p>
<p>At the 2003 JCI Leadership Summit at the UN-New York, JCI took responsibility to contribute to the efforts of the UN and presented a resolution supporting the MDGs.</p>
<p>At the 2004 Summit, JCI decided to focus on the promotion of the MDGs 1 and 6 in Africa/Middle East, MDG 1 in Asia/Pacific, MDGs 4 and 8 in the Americas and MDG 8 in Europe.</p>
<p>At the 2007 Summit, JCI presented resolutions deepening actions under the MDGs 1, 4, 6 and 8.</p>
<p>At the 2008 Summit, JCI focused on the Corporate Social Responsibility, with the support of the UN Global Compact, and presented actions on it.</p>
<p>In 2009, JCI will host a Summit at the UN-Geneva, with the support of the UN Global Compact and the International Chamber of Commerce, to explore, propose and take actions on Climate Change and, accordingly, issue a &quot;Commitment to Action&quot; on Climate Change.</p>
<p>Each year, JCI members organize thousands of projects dedicated to advancing the goals. The goals provide a framework for targeting local problems to improve communities worldwide.</p>
<p>JCI Local and National Organizations have been posting their projects related to the MDGs at the JCI Project Gallery.</p>
<p>Climate Change: Making Global Impact Through Local Actions</p>
<h2 id="you-ve-heard-the-talk-about-climate-change-but-what-can-we-as-young-active-citizens-do-">You&#39;ve heard the talk about climate change. But what can we as young active citizens do?</h2>
<p>Scientists tell us that actions taken—or not taken—will have a profound effect on the future of our world. As global citizens committed to positive change, environmental sustainability is a serious issue for JCI in 2009.</p>
<p>JCI has a commitment to advance the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which both contain resolutions for environmental sustainability. That’s why in 2009 JCI is addressing this global problem. The 2009 JCI Leadership Summit at the UN in Geneva will focus on climate change and what we can do across the organization, but don’t wait until July to get started. Take action today to offset the negative effects of environmental damage.</p>
<h3 id="commit">COMMIT</h3>
<p>Making a commitment to reduce the carbon footprint on a personal or organizational level is the first step toward impacting climate change. As young active citizens working toward positive change, our actions will resonate in our communities to show our commitment to environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>In Japan, JCI Kyoto Members obtained certification for Kyoto Environmental Management System (KES), a set of standards to manage and reduce the burden to the environment in running organizations of any size. To maintain their certification, JCI Kyoto members set concrete goals and executed projects to preserve the environment, educate the public, raise awareness and reduce the organization’s burden to the environment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Organizing Committee of the 2009 JCI European Conference has committed itself to carbon neutrality, and has initiated projects such as tree planting to offset the carbon footprint of the Conference.</p>
<h3 id="educate-yourself">EDUCATE YOURSELF</h3>
<p>Do you know what your carbon footprint is? Or what the experts are saying about climate change? Read up on how climate change is affecting our world today at the United Nations Environmental Programme website (UNEP), including Questions and Answers with UNEP experts.</p>
<p>Once you’ve studied, educate members of your local community and call them to action. Members of JCI Hammamchatt in Tunisia raised awareness about the seriousness of climate change and called participants to act to reverse climate change in their daily lives in their “Lasting Development” seminar. The seminar focused on teaching people how to produce and consume differently to make a lasting change, both for this generation and the generations of the future.</p>
<h3 id="act">ACT</h3>
<p>Individual, local, national - climate change can be combated at every level. Choose a project tailored to your community, and begin today.</p>
<p>Members of JCI Coronel Oviedo in Paraguay took action to raise community awareness about climate change and preserve the environment by planting 700 trees in their local community.</p>
<p>JCI Menton Roquebrune Cap Martin in France took the initiative to clean up the French Riviera with its Boat Service project. The project included steps to educate yacht operators about the negative effects of pollution and waste collection in the Riviera.</p>
<p>Learn more about what you can do as an organization or an individual with the UNEP’s Twelve Steps to Kick the CO2 Habit.</p>
<h3 id="unite">UNITE</h3>
<p>Joining together with other like-minded groups and individuals magnifies the impact of climate change efforts. Within the JCI global network, join in the discussion at workshops on climate change at each of the four Area Conferences.</p>
<p>And this July, don’t miss the opportunity to unite with other JCI Members to develop concrete plans to impact climate change at the JCI Leadership Summit at the UN in Geneva. Registration is open until June 26. Register today</p>
<p>Find partners working toward the same goals in your community, or tap into larger networks. To make an organization-wide commitment at the global level, check out the Caring for Climate platform of the UN Global Compact or the Climate Neutral Network</p>

    <div id="Climate"><h2 id="climate-change">Climate Change</h2>
<p>As global citizens committed to positive change, JCI members will focus on environmental sustainability in 2009.</p>
<p>JCI has a commitment to advance the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which both contain resolutions for environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Members will create initiatives both locally and globally at the 2009 Area Conferences and the 2009 JCI Leadership Summit at the United Nations.</p>
<p>Overwhelming scientific evidence says that climate change is real. Today we face climbing temperatures, CO2 pollution, flooding, intense droughts; melting glaciers and rising sea levels. At the 2008 UN Conference on Climate Change, experts declared that by continuing on the current path, we will face ecological catastrophes that will cause a profoundly negative effect on human development in every part of the world.</p>
<p>A healthy planet is a part of global economic and social well-being, making climate change a serious issue for JCI. That why we&#39;re committed to advancing the UN Millennium Development Goals including Goal 7: Environmental Sustainability. We&#39;re also working to advance the values of the UN Global Compact, which includes three principles that regard environmental responsibility as an obligation of all citizens and businesses.</p>
<p>By promoting environmental conservation, educating and developing awareness among members and in local communities, JCI is helping to stop the negative impact of climate change and make positive changes in a new direction, ensuring a brighter future for our planet.</p>

    <div id="NothingButNets"><h2 id="jci-nothing-but-nets-campaign">JCI Nothing But Nets Campaign</h2>
<h3 id="malaria-kills">Malaria Kills</h3>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is the largest single cause of death among children under the age of five, killing one child every 30 seconds, more than 800,000 per year.</p>
<p>Malaria has been brought under control and even eliminated in many parts of Asia, Europe and the Americas. Yet in Africa, malaria infections have actually increased over the last three decades. Malaria accounts for 40 per cent of public health expenditures. </p>
<h3 id="nets-save">Nets Save</h3>
<p>Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are a form of personal protection that has repeatedly been shown to reduce severe disease and mortality due to malaria in endemic regions. Indeed studies show that use of insecticide-treated bed nets can reduce transmission as much as 90% in areas with high coverage rates.</p>
<p>To maintain the efficacy of ITNs, the nets must be retreated at intervals of 6-12 months, more frequently if the nets are washed. Re-treatment is done by simply dipping nets in a mixture of water and insecticide and allowing the nets to dry in a shady place. Kits for retreating nets are available in most countries.</p>
<p>The need for frequent re-treatments is one of the most difficult barriers to full implementation of ITNs in endemic countries. The additional cost of the insecticide and the lack of understanding of its importance result in very low re-treatment rates in most African countries. Several companies have developed long-lasting ITNs that theoretically retain lethal concentrations of insecticide for the life of the net (3-5 years).</p>
<h3 id="jci-takes-action">JCI Takes Action</h3>
<p>In this context, based on the 2004 JCI Resolution to Advance the UN MDGs, JCI wants to contribute to diminish the mortality rate of children under the age of five by mobilizing its organizations in 115 countries to raise funds to purchase and distribute ITNs, as well as to conduct educational campaigns to teach families how to use the ITNs correctly. </p>
<p>At present, JCI and UNF are studying countries to deliver ITNs as well as educate the population on how to use them.</p>
<p>In addition, JCI and UNF will soon start working on the toolkits.</p>
<p>The JCI-UN Affairs Commission members Benjamin Kong (Chairman, from Hong Kong), Joseph Pheto (Botswana), Aboubakar Chekarao (Niger), Moon Seok-Kyun (South Korea), Nitin Thakkar (India), Gabriela Filippini (Argentina), Scott Kingsley (USA), Christian Letsch (Germany) and Torbjorn Berglund (Sweden) have been working hard by delivering awareness to the countries assigned to them and collecting funds to the campaign. Their goal is to raise 130,000 ITNs in 2009.</p>

<p>Every 30 seconds, another person dies of Malaria. With the JCI Nothing But Nets campaign, JCI members across the globe have committed to taking concrete action in their communities to fight this deadly disease.In March 2008, JCI launched JCI Nothing But Nets in partnership with the UN Foundation’s Nothing But Nets. To join the campaign, JCI set the ambitious goal of raising funds for one million insecticide-nets and distributing them by 2015. Now 10 months into the project, JCI members have raised 8,005 nets, or $80,050.61.</p>
<p>And there’s no stopping now.</p>
